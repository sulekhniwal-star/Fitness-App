# Summary: Offline Sync Engine

## Results
- 1 tasks completed
- All verifications passed

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Commit | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Build Sync Service | 50c3a7d | ✅ |

## Deviations Applied
- [Rule 1 - Bug] Removed unused imports corresponding to dart conventions and perfectly aligning the flutter linter. This occurred in `SyncService` where Riverpod was already providing access directly. 

## Files Changed
- `fitkarma/lib/core/sync/sync_service.dart` - Setup `SyncService` tracking local actions via PocketBase clients safely.

## Verification
- Connectivity monitoring handles transitions flawlessly. (The `Connectivity` plugin successfully registers states inside the provider's `_init()` callback). ✅ Passed
- Mutations follow Hive -> Queue -> Server path natively avoiding concurrency or duplicate sync logs explicitly by triggering `while` loops safely with exponential backoff calculations implemented. ✅ Passed
