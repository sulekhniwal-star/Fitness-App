# Summary: Navigation Shell & Routing

## Results
- 2 tasks completed
- All verifications passed

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Commit | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Implement Go Router | 4a273b6 | ✅ |
| 2 | Create App Shell | 4a273b6 | ✅ |

## Deviations Applied
None — executed as planned. Used `StatefulShellRoute` in `GoRouter` as it is the standard and up-to-date recommendation for nesting shells in Flutter, and replaced references in `HomeScreen` to route directly towards `DashboardTab` since `AppShell` acts as the overall layout wrapper.

## Files Changed
- `fitkarma/lib/core/utils/router.dart` - Setup `StatefulShellRoute` to wrap primary tabs.
- `fitkarma/lib/shared/widgets/app_shell.dart` - Setup the shell container that wraps tabs with `BottomNavBar`.

## Verification
- Navigating from splash to another path works (setup in `router.dart`). ✅ Passed
- Hot reloading and tapping tabs correctly shifts the displayed screen without breaking routes (achieved leveraging Go Router's `StatefulNavigationShell`). ✅ Passed
