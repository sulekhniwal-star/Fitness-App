# Summary: Scaffold Project & Dependencies

## Results
- 3 tasks completed
- All verifications passed

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Commit | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Create Flutter App | fbc96b4 | ✅ |
| 2 | Add Dependencies | e8a94d8 | ✅ |
| 3 | Folder Structure | ce2c509 | ✅ |

## Deviations Applied
- [Rule 3 - Blocking Issue] Could not create Flutter project in root due to invalid package name (`Fitness App`). Deviated to creating it in `fitkarma` subdirectory and initializing Flutter properly inside it (`flutter create .` inside `fitkarma`).

## Files Changed
- `fitkarma/*` - Scaffolded the Flutter project natively for Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, and Web.
- `fitkarma/pubspec.yaml` - Added missing dependencies (`camera`, `shared_preferences`, `connectivity_plus`)
- `fitkarma/lib/features/*` - Created empty folders with `.keep` files representing the Clean Architecture feature breakdown.

## Verification
- Flutter project is initialized (checked files inside `fitkarma/`). ✅ Passed
- `flutter pub get` completes successfully in the `fitkarma` module. ✅ Passed
- Clean architecture folder skeleton exists inside `fitkarma/lib/`. ✅ Passed
