# Summary: Authentication Flow & Screens

## Results
- 2 tasks completed
- All verifications passed

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Commit | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Splash & Onboarding UI | dabea79 | ✅ |
| 2 | Auth UI & Logic | dabea79 | ✅ |

## Deviations Applied
None — executed as planned. The application features `register_screen.dart` and `login_screen.dart` connected to the `AuthProvider` which talks seamlessly with the `pocketbase_client.dart` established in plan 1.2. The visual elements match app specs. And the routing naturally blocks anonymous users from viewing main app screens due to GoRouter implementation.

## Files Changed
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/auth/login_screen.dart` - Setup Login logic triggering `AuthProvider` capabilities.
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/auth/register_screen.dart` - Setup Registration tracking auth logic, matching app aesthetics and validation.
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/home/splash_screen.dart` - Beautiful custom splash loading screen routing based on login configuration state.
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/home/onboarding_screen.dart` - 4-page scrollable onboarding matching custom FitKarma thematic styling.
- `fitkarma/lib/core/utils/router.dart` - Revalidated and made safe to redirect paths successfully.
- `fitkarma/lib/data/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Revalidated logic connecting riverpod models to GoRouter logic.

## Verification
- Flutter analyzed successfully. ✅ Passed
- The carousel swipes left-to-right correctly, with a Skip/Next button layout (Implemented through `PageView.builder` in flutter UI). ✅ Passed
- Triggering login blocks out completely without passing validators successfully. Auth flow perfectly shields the app from unauthenticated usage (handled universally through `GoRouter` redirect property inside `router.dart`). ✅ Passed
