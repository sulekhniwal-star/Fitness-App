# Plan 3.2: Festival Modes & Fasting - Summary

## Tasks Completed
- Bind Global Calorie Targets: Integrated `getAdjustedCalorieGoal` within `meal_provider.dart` to apply dynamic multiplication to the core foundational algorithm. When a user creates meal plans locally during Indian festival days configured structurally within `festivalProvider`'s native chron-mappings, the baseline targets natively scale into safe "Fasting" variants reflecting cultural observance seamlessly offline.

## Verification
- Code analyzer clears modifications locally.
- Function parameters properly compute maintenance calories before injecting contextual dynamic mathematical modifiers.

## Status
✅ Complete
