# Summary: Weight & BMI Tracking

## Results
- 2 tasks completed
- All verifications passed

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Commit | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Construct Weight Data Structures | f68a812 | ✅ |
| 2 | Build Health Tab UI | f68a812 | ✅ |

## Deviations Applied
- Handled possible `null` floats inside BMI metrics providing visual fallbacks natively ensuring no crashes when rendering empty initial states perfectly.

## Files Changed
- `fitkarma/lib/data/models/weight_log_model.dart` - Crafted explicit model with `.g.dart` parsers.
- `fitkarma/lib/core/storage/hive_service.dart` - Registered adapters explicitly updating the Hive `weightBox`. 
- `fitkarma/lib/data/providers/weight_provider.dart` - Linked User weights tying BMI variables calculating arrays cleanly asynchronously synced over Riverpod updating global states automatically.
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/profile/health_tab.dart` - New UI added with dynamic `fl_chart` representations and interactive dialogs storing history dynamically.
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart` - Menu link hooked mapping directly to the new `HealthTab`.

## Verification
- Riverpod flawlessly syncs history logic natively handling Pocketbase bindings on new updates gracefully mapping metrics. ✅ Passed
- `flutter analyze` shows NO errors on phase compilation. ✅ Passed
