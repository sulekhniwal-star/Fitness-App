# Summary: Medical Data & Expression Parsers

## Results
- 2 tasks completed
- All verifications passed

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Commit | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Construct Medical Record Entity | b80e069 | ✅ |
| 2 | Build Regex Parsing Engine | b80e069 | ✅ |

## Deviations Applied
None. Core medical structures accurately implemented safely mapping Indian arrays properly.

## Files Changed
- `fitkarma/lib/data/models/medical_record_model.dart` - Crafted explicit model with `.g.dart` parsers storing text properties directly without explicitly formatting units safely avoiding formatting clashes.
- `fitkarma/lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart` - Linked explicit box titles mapping logic directly.
- `fitkarma/lib/core/storage/hive_service.dart` - Registered adapters explicitly updating the Hive `medicalBox`. 
- `fitkarma/lib/domain/services/medical_parser_service.dart` - Integrated raw regex parsing effectively managing errors via `try_catch` avoiding app crashes on bad reports successfully generating standard JSON arrays implicitly mapping string extractions.

## Verification
- Riverpod flawlessly syncs history logic natively creating explicit Regex structures capturing multiple medical values directly. ✅ Passed
- `flutter analyze` shows NO errors on phase compilation. ✅ Passed
