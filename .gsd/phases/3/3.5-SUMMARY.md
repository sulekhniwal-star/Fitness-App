## Results
- 2 tasks completed
- All verifications passed

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Commit | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Camera & Image Picker Pipeline | f3e02cf | ✅ |
| 2 | OCR Trigger & RegEx Integration | f3e02cf | ✅ |

## Deviations Applied
None. Correctly configured `google_mlkit_text_recognition` binding into editable dialog UI safely mapping string arrays into explicit model creations syncing natively.

## Files Changed
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/profile/medical_scanner_screen.dart` - UI created capturing image paths asynchronously sending mapped states through regex bindings instantiating `MedicalRecordModels` dynamically rewarding Karma via proper state providers.
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart` - Linked 'Medical Reports' menu mapping explicitly into the scanner screen efficiently traversing paths.

## Verification
- OCR parses properly capturing generic values displaying into TextFields reliably hooking into Pocketbase queries saving records safely giving Karma successfully. ✅ Passed
- `flutter analyze` shows NO errors on phase compilation. ✅ Passed
