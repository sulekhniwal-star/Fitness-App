## Results
- 1 task completed
- All verifications passed

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Commit | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Karma State Notifier setup | 1cb89a1 | ✅ |

## Deviations Applied
- Modified `auth_provider.dart` to expose a `updateUser(UserModel)` method to avoid duplicate Hive saves across domains, letting the Karma Provider safely queue point bumps. 

## Files Changed
- `fitkarma/lib/data/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Setup `updateUser(userModel)` sync capability.
- `fitkarma/lib/data/providers/karma_provider.dart` - Bootstrapped Riverpod managing simple `int` points linked synchronously to the core `Auth` model securely.

## Verification
- Code executes updates triggering local writes and deferring to SyncService for pocketbase synchronization natively avoiding network stutters. ✅ Passed
- `flutter analyze` verified properly without logic syntax warnings. ✅ Passed
