# Summary: Food Logging UI & Actions

## Results
- 2 tasks completed
- All verifications passed

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Commit | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Search API & Barcode Scanning UI | 076f425 | ✅ |
| 2 | Logging Flow & Karma Sync | 076f425 | ✅ |

## Deviations Applied
- Handled Search Delegate API natively using Riverpod without pushing local state complexity.

## Files Changed
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/food/food_search_delegate.dart` - Setup the explicit search list building asynchronously via Riverpod query triggers.
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/food/food_logging_screen.dart` - Connected scanner using `barcode_scan2` mapping its output over the newly created `FoodSearchDelegate`. 

## Verification
- Scan functionality opens native platform scanner mapping ISBN code into Riverpod data logic. ✅ Passed
- Upon clicking an item within the search list, it correctly caches logging states giving Karma via API cleanly. ✅ Passed
