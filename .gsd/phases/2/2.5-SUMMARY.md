- All verifications passed

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Commit | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Link Up Progress State | 5014617 | ✅ |
| 2 | Deploy Weekly Graph Data | 5014617 | ✅ |

## Deviations Applied
- Handled `StepState` collision with `flutter/material.dart` `Stepper` internally by cleanly `hide`-ing it. 
- Integrated historical Hive storage dates accurately linking to UI charts dynamically without crashing arrays.

## Files Changed
- `fitkarma/lib/presentation/screens/home/dashboard_tab.dart` - Dropped mock `4500` numbers integrating `stepProvider` natively. Added Hive 7-day lookups directly building pie charts.

## Verification
- Code successfully renders the Dashboard capturing the live points accurately inside the fl_chart maps. ✅ Passed
- `flutter analyze` shows NO errors on phase compilation. ✅ Passed
