# Plan 4.1: AI Health Twin Data Mining - Summary

## Tasks Completed
- Bind Real Step Analytics: Audited the `HealthTwinService` resolving mock metric usages. Replaced the `_analyzeWeekendSlump` array stubs into dynamically iterating backwards mapping `Hive`'s date keys (`history_Y-M-D`). Computed exact active totals and enforced a generic 50% baseline algorithm dropoff specifically to trigger notifications against authentic data accurately.

## Verification
- AI analytics trigger explicitly leveraging existing synced datasets.
- Analyzer clears updates properly isolating date parsing boundaries.

## Status
✅ Complete
